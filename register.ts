/**
 * Tell a host on this machine where this app answers.
 *
 *   bun run register            # or: PORT=7950 bun run register
 *
 * A separate program from `run.sh` on purpose. Registration writes into
 * somebody's home directory and says "frame this", which is a decision a person
 * makes once; a start script that did it quietly would be making that decision
 * on their behalf every time they pressed start.
 *
 * ## The filename is the module id
 *
 * Not a field inside the file — the NAME. A host sweeps the directory and takes
 * the id from the filename, so `roadmap.learning.json` is what makes this
 * `roadmap.learning`. Two files naming the same port under different names are
 * two modules as far as a host is concerned.
 *
 * ## `dir` as well as `url`
 *
 * The url is where to talk to this app; the directory is where to start it. A
 * host that offers a Start button needs the second, and needs it to be a
 * DIRECTORY rather than a command line — a string a host handed to a shell would
 * make this file a place to write shell. What a host runs is `run.sh` inside
 * this directory: one script, no arguments, for exactly that reason.
 *
 * It is derived from this file's own location rather than from `process.cwd()`,
 * so `bun run register` works from anywhere and records where the program
 * actually is instead of where somebody happened to be standing.
 *
 * ## Where a host looks
 *
 * This line must say exactly what a host's own registry sweep says, and it is
 * copied rather than imported because this directory is meant to stand alone.
 * Writing to the wrong directory is the worst failure a module can have: the
 * host finds nothing, and finds it silently.
